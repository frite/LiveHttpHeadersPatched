LiveHTTPHeaders Patched
========
The original LiveHHTPHeaders Firefox Add on patched. The original repo is [here](http://www.mozdev.org/source/browse/livehttpheaders/#dirlist). I patched it only to find out that another guy did exactly the same [here](http://www.mrt-prodz.com/blog/view/2014/09/fixing-live-http-headers-017-add-on) and when I contacted him on Twitter he gave me a link of the [bug report](https://www.mozdev.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=25309) he submitted.
About the repo

The structure is exactly the same. The patched version is called livehhtpheaders-0.17-patched.xpi. The structure is exactly the same. The patch lies in the LiveHHTPReplay.js file. Hopefully someone will fork the original project and continue its development :)
